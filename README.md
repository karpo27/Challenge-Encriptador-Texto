## Installation
To use this program, simply download the code files and open the index.html file in a web browser. There is no need to install any additional software or dependencies.

## Rules
The usage of this program involves two main actions: encryption and decryption. The user enters a text in the input area, and then they can either encrypt or decrypt the text using the corresponding buttons.

When the "Encrypt" button is clicked, the program applies a code matrix to the text and replaces certain characters with corresponding code words. The resulting text is displayed in the message area.

When the "Decrypt" button is clicked, the program applies the same code matrix to the text and replaces code words with corresponding characters. The resulting text is displayed in the message area.
